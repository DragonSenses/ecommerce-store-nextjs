# A new journey!

I'm excited to start on another project, this time with many new things.

As you know during my previous project [job-tracker](https://github.com/DragonSenses/job-tracker), during the months of March 2023 to June 2023 the React documentation was still in [beta](https://beta.reactjs.org/) but almost complete.

It was during that time when React finally promoted the beta docs to the official [React documentation](https://react.dev/)!

You can still see the old documentation in https://legacy.reactjs.org

## What's new?

- Hooks and Functional Components as Default (a strong usage of Hooks and functional components as the standard approach)
- Interactive demos and challenges

And one of the biggest changes:
- Removal of the [Create React App (CRA)](https://create-react-app.dev/), the official Facebook-maintained React quick-configuration tool. The legacy docs recommended CRA as "the best way to start building a new single-page application in React"

CRA had a lack of features (such as native support for TypeScript or CSS library Tailwind), size, performance. Just like Blizzard's StarCraft 2, **CRA is no longer maintained**.

## What to use then!?

[Official React docs](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#create-react-app) recommends using the following frameworks:

- **Next.js**
- **Remix**
- **Gatsby**

## Next.js 

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a full-stack React framework. It's versatile and lets you create React apps of any size - from a mostly static blog to a complex dynamic application.
